# My Twelfth Coding Challenge
Hello again! This is my twelfth coding challenge using JavaScript. Here, I will apply my JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Event Handling skills, by creating a businessdashboard that displays key metrics and an inventory list of products. 
My project is split into 4 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Business Dashboard – DOM Element Selection and Creation
+ Task 2:  Updating Dashboard Metrics – Working with NodeLists and Arrays
+ Task 3: Dynamic Inventory Management – Adding and Removing Items
+ Task 4: Business Customer Section – Handling Event Bubbling

I hope that you enjoy my attempt on the challenge!
